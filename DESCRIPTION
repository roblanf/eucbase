Title: Calculating Species-Level Statistics and Plotting Trait Distributions of
    Point Occurrence Data and Layers
Version: 1.2.0
Authors@R: person("Fred", "Jaya", email = "fredjaya1@gmail.com", 
    role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Calculates point occurrence data by summarising points to a user- 
    specified grid size (km). Species point data with corresponding 
    environmental/climatic layers is input to generate species-level means of 
    environmental factors. Point data and existing species life-history traits 
    are taken to generate (gridded) spatial distribution plots.
