Title: Calculating Species-Level Statistics and Plotting Trait Distributions of
    ALA Point Occurrence Data and Layers
Version: 1.0.0

Description: Calculates point occurrence data by summarising points to a 
    user-specified grid size (km). Two primary uses are currently available.
    Raw species point data downloaded from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)
	act as an input to generate species-level means of environmental factors.
    Point data and existing species life history traits are taken to generate 
    (gridded) spatial distribution plots.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.3)
